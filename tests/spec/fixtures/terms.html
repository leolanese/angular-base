In order to assess your details and verify your registration we may supply the information you have given us to authorized credit reference / identity verification agencies to confirm your identity and card details.

In the event that we terminate your account due to lack of sufficient proof of age, we shall (1) void any and all play by you including any winnings accruing to you and (2) return the amount of all funds deposited by you to the Site, less any funds previously withdrawn by you and subject to additional terms as set out in the Account Management below.

Failure to inform us of such changes may result in transactions being declined by your bank, building society or credit card company, and we shall not accept any liability or responsibility for transactions that are declined as a result of your failure to provide us with correct personal details. It is also your responsibility to protect your debit and/or credit card for loss or theft, and you should contact Customer Service immediately should your card be lost or stolen. Please note that no changes may be made to your first name, last name and date of birth as originally entered upon registration, unless you provide us with evidence to our satisfaction that these, and any other personal details, have been legally changed according to the laws of the jurisdiction in which you reside.</li>
    <li>If you have breached any requirement listed above, we reserve the right to close the relevant account and refund all or part of the funds in any additional accounts. The maximum amount refunded, if any, will not exceed the total amount of deposits, less any withdrawal requests that have been paid. All winnings may be forfeited and we reserve the right to terminate your account with us immediately. We also reserve the right to deduct our reasonable transactional costs.</li>
    <li>Continued breach may, at our discretion, result in the termination of all the relevant accounts and banning you from the Site. We reserve the right to terminate all affected accounts if we conclude, acting reasonably, that more than one of such accounts is being operated by, or is under the control of, a single person.</li>
    <li>Where we have a serious suspicion of fraudulent activity on an account, we reserve the right to withhold the payment of funds to you until the end of the charge-back period which applies to the payment method used to pay in the relevant funds.</li>
    <li>All deposits that you make with us from time to time shall be kept separate and distinct from the funds of ours and shall be managed and administered by us or third party payment processors.</li>
    <li class="last">In the event that you forget your password, or that your password becomes, or you suspect that it may become, known to any unauthorised person, you will immediately notify us of such event. After ten persistent consecutive incorrect entries of a username and password combination in a 60 minute period, your Account will be temporarily suspended for security reasons and we will require you to send us an official photographic proof of identity being a National Identity Card, Passport or Driving Licence in order for the Account to be reactivated. We reserve the right to change your Player ID at any time in our sole and absolute discretion, and we will notify you of any changes made to this/these by using the contact details with which you have provided us.</li>
</ul>

Failure to inform us of changes affecting your account may result in transactions being declined by your bank, building society, or credit card company. We do not accept any liability or responsibility of any sort for transactions that are declined or associated fees as a result of your failure to provide us with your correct, up-to-date details.</li>
    <li><strong>Credit/Debit Cards, e-Wallets and other payment methods: Loss &amp; Theft</strong>.

You understand and agree that we may demand additional information from you and you must provide the same in the event that we wish to conduct a security check on your account.

</ul>
<h4><strong>Closure of Accounts, Suspension and Termination </strong></h4>
<ul>
    <li class="first"><strong>Inactive Accounts</strong>. An inactive account is where a balance exists but no real money wager has occurred by the player within the previous rolling 12 month period. Should an account become Inactive we shall use reasonable efforts to notify the account holder, using the email address provided to us by the account holder. Should an account become inactive we hold the funds for the registered account holder to claim for a further 12 months in accordance with the legal requirements and the regulations that apply to this Site before disbursing the funds to the nominated charity, Gambling Research Education and Treatment (GREaT), supporting funding for treatment of and research into problem gambling. If contact is successfully made, it is possible that the last payment method used is no longer valid and therefore another method will be required. In this instance, a management payment interface will be used to authorize an alternate payment and send this request to be prepared. This payment will then be processed following normal withdrawal procedures.</li>
    <li><strong>Unallocated Funds:</strong> From time to time, we will hold funds which are not allocated to customers. This may occur for a number of reasons including where a customer’s winnings are forfeited, or if we are unable to place funds in an account because it has already been closed by the customer. We may use these funds for a variety of purposes including using them for donations to registered charities, developing and improving the Site, increasing winnings in specified games, or anything else we reasonably believe to be appropriate.</li>

    <li class="first"><strong>Fun Play or Restricted Accounts</strong>: Players can also play for fun without full cash registration and without wagering with real funds (“Fun Play”). Such registration only requires email address, Player ID, password, country, and birthdate. However, for the avoidance of doubt, when using a “Fun Play Account” the user is not wagering actual funds, the wagers made and prizes won shall be for credits that have no monetary value and do not involve real funds or actual gambling. Regardless of your location, at no time will any player be allowed to make a real money wager using a Fun Play Account. All games on the Site, whether played for fun or with real funds, use the same math models, pay tables, and theoretical odds so the results a player obtains will be the same in all play instances. Fun Play will be denied if you are located in a territory where playing for fun is deemed at our discretion to be not permissible. Fun Play Accounts will also be blocked from those countries appearing on the prohibited list for software export, published by the United States Bureau of Industry and Security. Fun Play players may not have the right to unlimited free play as WMS may suspend, limit or terminate your access to all or any part of the Site, including Fun Play, at any time, for any or no reason, with or without prior notice, and without liability.</li>

<p id="withdrawal_procedures"><strong>6. WITHDRAWAL PROCEDURES AND WINNINGS</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li class="first">In order for you to withdraw funds from your account, you must have a withdrawable cash balance (not solely bonus or promotional funds in the account).</li>
    <li><strong>Method of Withdrawal</strong>. You can make withdrawals from your account up to the amount of your current available balance using only the last payment method / instrument used to deposit. For the avoidance of doubt, this balance does not include Bonuses and or Promotions. We reserve the right to request further information prior to any withdrawals and any monies due or requested shall be withheld until the requested information has been provided to our satisfaction.</li>
    <li><strong>Major Withdrawals</strong>. In order to make a withdrawal from your account which is in excess of £2,500 you will be required to contact our Customer Services Team.</li>
    <li><strong>Withdrawal. </strong>Each withdrawal must be at least £10 (save in the case of a final withdrawal to close an account) and must be no greater than £2,500 per day, unless expressly authorized on a case-by-case basis. A final withdrawal to close an account must be communicated to Customer Service. If you are withdrawing £2,500 for the first time, we will ask you to provide us with paper copies of your passport and/or drivers license, Government ID, or other official government issued photo identity card. At our discretion, we may also request a recent bank / credit card statement verifying your registered home address. Withdrawals to a credit card may only be made to the card you have registered to your account and used to deposit funds. In exceptional circumstances where a withdrawal cannot be made to the card used, a withdrawal will be made by cheque, or at our discretion a bank transfer. In such circumstances we reserve the right to exercise a higher level of diligence than for other transactions. This diligence may include requesting further verification of identification. When a withdrawal is made by cheque, a UK issued cheque will be payable directly to you (and not any third party) and will be sent to you at the home address registered with us. A service charge of £2 may be deducted from your account for each such withdrawal.</li>
    <li><strong>Credit Cards and Bank Transfers:</strong> You are aware that some credit card companies classify gambling transactions as “cash” and may therefore place a fixed and/ or interest charge from the date of payment. Withdrawals via bank transfers to bank accounts may also attract bank charges which may vary according to the amount of money transferred and which have to be met by you.</li>
    <li><strong>Incorrect transfers:</strong> If any sum is incorrectly credited to your account you are obliged to notify us and we are entitled to reverse such credits and/ or recover such sums from you, even if withdrawn by you or improperly used to participate in the Services on the Site. We reserve the right to cancel or reverse any winnings to recover such sums.</li>
    <li><strong>Locally Issued Credit or Debit Cards: </strong>For players originating in the United Kingdom, we will only accept deposits from United Kingdom issued credit or debit cards. For players originating from outside the UK, we will only accept deposits from Visa debit or credit cards issued by banks located in the player’s country or jurisdiction of origin.</li>
    <li><strong>Bonuses and Promotions</strong>. In the event of a promotional campaign or competition, where we credit promotional or bonus funds to your account, such funds are subject to the specific terms of the particular promotional campaign or competition. Bonus or promotional funds may only be used in conjunction with the games or products specified when the bonus is offered or awarded and the use and withdrawal of such bonus funds shall only be in strict accordance with the applicable terms and conditions of the relevant bonus offering or promotion, including minimum play through amounts. We reserve the right to reclaim bonus amounts credited to your account if you do not use them to play games during the period specified in the relevant promotion or if you attempt to withdraw them from your account without satisfying any conditions required before such funds may be withdrawn by you. You should always read the terms that apply to a bonus that has been awarded to you before you commence playing. Unless otherwise expressly described in the terms and conditions of the relevant bonus promotion, the bonus amounts deposited to your account will be withdrawn by us and not otherwise paid or credited to you when playing the game or games for which it may be applied before any other funds deposited in your account will be withdrawn. Any Bonus or promotion offered by us is limited to one account which shall mean no more than one Bonus and/or Promotion per account holder. You may be eligible to participate in Bonus programmes and or Promotions, the conditions, amount and issuance of which shall be subject to our sole and absolute discretion, and shall be non-transferrable. In order to withdraw the Bonus and/or Promotion funds from your account, the Bonus and or Promotion received will be subject to the specific terms of that bonus, including any applicable wagering requirements.</li>
    <li><strong>Taxes and Fees</strong>. All taxes and fees payable on your winnings (or any other payments we may make to you) and all tax filings are your sole responsibility. Winnings cannot be transferred, substituted, or redeemed for any other consideration. We reserve the right to make tax filings or other reports related to your use of the Site or any winnings paid to you.</li>
    <li><strong>Payout Rates and Pay tables</strong> We reserve the right, at our sole and absolute discretion, to make changes to the payout rates and pay tables applicable to the games. The payout rate of each slot game can be viewed by clicking on the Help / Pays button of the button panel and then by forwarding to the page entitled “Winlines” within the relevant game. The pay tables for the non-slot games (table, card, etc.) can be viewed by clicking on any button that reads “Paytable”; however, if no payable button is viewable from the game, then by selecting a button or icon with the word “Help” on it. It is your responsibility to note the payout rate and pay tables applying to each game in each session prior to placing a stake or wager.</li>
    <li><strong>Maximum Non-Progressive Win Amounts on the Site. </strong>Each game on the Site, other than progressive jackpots, has a maximum amount that may be won. Accordingly, no win on any single wager on a game other than a progressive jackpot can exceed £250,000 British Sterling (the “Win Cap”), and some games may have significantly lower Win Caps. The Win Cap for each game is disclosed on the same page as the payout rates and / or pay tables for such game. We also reserve the right to change the Win Cap amounts from time to time, including increasing the Win Cap for specific users at our sole and absolute discretion. Any updates or changes to Win Caps shall appear on the relevant part of the Site mentioned above. Any winnings in excess of the maximum disclosed amount or Win Cap will be void and not paid.</li>
    <li class="last"><strong>Promotions and Publicity</strong>. We will us your real name and likeness for advertising and promotional purposes without additional compensation, except where and to the extent prohibited by law, however we will contact you before we publish your details and you will have the right to have us not disclose your details.

    <li class="last"><strong>Wagering Terms: </strong>For the avoidance of doubt the terms “wager”, “stake” and “bet” shall all have the same meaning.</li>

<ul>
    <li class="first"><strong>Self-Exclusion</strong>.

You can self-exclude up to three times. At any time, you may instruct us to exclude you from gambling on this Site and to close your account permanently. Once your request to permanently close your account is processed by our Customer Service team, no further wagers will be accepted from you, your account will be closed and any funds in your account credited back to you. It is important that you do not attempt to open multiple accounts with us. If you require any information relating to this facility please contact our Customer Services at <a href="mailto:support@jackpotparty.com">support@jackpotparty.com</a>. We will use our reasonable endeavours to ensure compliance with self exclusion. However you accept that we have no responsibility or liability whatsoever if you continue gambling and/ or seek to use the Site or any of its Services and we fail to recognize or determine that you have required self exclusion in circumstances beyond our reasonable control. For example including but not limited to you opening a new account or using a different name or address.</li>
    <li><strong>Imposition of Limits</strong>. In addition, you may set limits on your gambling by accessing the Responsible Gaming tab on the Site (and also accessible through the Options menu in each game). If you notify us of limits that you wish to set in relation to your gambling, we will not accept a deposit in excess of the notified limits. Any removal of or increase in deposit limits will take 36 hours to take effect and may not exceed the house limits. Any reduction in deposit limits will take place immediately.</li>
    <li><strong>Responsible Gambling</strong>. We take responsible gambling extremely seriously. We maintain procedures to attempt to identify players who are, or who appear to be at risk of becoming compulsive gamblers. In addition to these and our other responsible gaming processes, we also reserve the right to exclude a player from the Site for their own safety at any time if we have reason to believe in our sole and absolute discretion that a player cannot control his or her gambling. The National Association for Gambling Care Education Resources and Training, (<a href="http://www.gamcare.org.uk/" target="_blank" title="GamCare &lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Opens in a New Window)&lt;/em&gt;">GamCare</a>), provides information advice and counseling to individuals, their families and friends who have concerns about problem gambling.
